# Zero-Lazagne
Bad Usb payload capable to capture victim's passwords hiding powershell and e-mailing them to you. Inspired by "Hasta Lasagna!", developed by m4ki3lf0 for Rubber Ducky, and optimized for Flipper Zero. 
## Notes
Tested with Unleashed Firmware and a SMTP without Ssl (port 25) to send the e-mail. The 2.4.2 version of lazagne.exe is a bit faster, anyway it's possibile to replace the download link with the latest version.
